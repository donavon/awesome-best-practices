# JavaScript Best Practices

### Variable
- Avoid global scope.
- Choose easy to understand and short names for variables and functions.
- Declare and initialize variable on top.
- Use shortcut notation for declare variable.

### Function
- Use descriptive names. Name should be a verb or a verb phrase.
- Avoid long argument list.
- Avoid default param.
- Reduce side effect.
- Single responsibility. Function either modifies or handle smth, but not both.

### Async code
- Use Promises where you need async code

### Common
- Use strict equal (===)
- Good code explains itself. Comment to code only if it needed.
