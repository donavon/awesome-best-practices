***

- #### Use try-catch

Try-catch is a JavaScript language construct that you can use to catch exceptions in synchronous code. Use try-catch, for example, to handle file(JSON, org and other) parsing errors as shown below.

***

- #### Donâ€™t use synchronous functions

Synchronous functions and methods tie up the executing process until they return.

***

- #### Use Promises

Promises will handle any exceptions (both explicit and implicit) in asynchronous code blocks that use then()
